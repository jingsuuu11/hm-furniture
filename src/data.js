'When choosing roses, go for those with simpler, open flowers that are closer to the wild or hedgerow roses, rather than anything too ornamental or blousy. Although wild roses only usually flower once in early summer, they produce beautiful hips for fall and winter interest.'And if you're looking to keep your roses – and all other plants – healthy, then you may need to learn how to add calcium to soil. This act will ensure the soil is at the best pH for growth as they encourage strong cell walls that ensure the plant grows upright."

Think about how entertaining spaces can flow out from the house with seating areas and smart patio ideas.In this total overhaul of an overgrown five acre site, central to the design is the large terrace area that sweeps around the house allowing views straight out from the kitchen and living room across colourful borders to the lake and wildflower meadow beyond. ‘To maintain those views, patio planting across the terrace is predominantly low with swathes of colour from Lavandula angustifolia ‘Hidcote’, Rosmarinus ‘Tuscan Blue’ and Veronica umbrosa ‘Georgia Blue’, ' says Claire Merriman of Claire Merriman Design(opens in new tab). 'Repeated spheres of Elaeagnus ebbingei, Hebe topiaria and Pittosporum tobira Nanum pull the areas of the terrace together while stunning multi-stem Koelreuteria paniculata trees allow views out into the wider landscape.’Pots on the terrace allow seasonal planting to be added throughout the year."
